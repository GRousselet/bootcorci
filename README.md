# bootcorci

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `bootcorci` is to provide bootstrap methods to compute
confidence intervals for correlation coefficients and their differences.
All the functions have been adapted from Rand Wilcox’s
[functions](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/rwilcox/software/). The
functions in the package have been standardised in their names, inputs
and outputs. When two versions of the same function existed to handle
separately Pearson’s correlation and robust correlations, the two
versions have been merged. Simplified versions of the correlation
functions have been created to speed up the bootstrap analyses. All the
bootstrap functions return the bootstrap samples.

## Functions

### Correlation functions

| name | purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| test | test    |

### Bootstrap functions

| name | purpose |

## Installation

You can install `bootcorci` from GitHub by using `devtools`:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GRousselet/bootcorci")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(bootcorci)
## basic example code
```

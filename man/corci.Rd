\title{Compute a 1-alpha percentile bootstrap confidence interval for a correlation.}
\usage{
corci(
  x,
  y,
  method = "pbcor",
  nboot = 2000,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  null.value = 0,
  saveboot = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Two vectors of the same length.}

\item{method}{A function that returns a correlation coefficient.
Options in \code{bootcorci} include "pearson", "spearman", "pbcor", "wincor".
Default is "pbcor".}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstrap samples. Default 2000.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha level. Default 0.05. For corfun = pearson, alpha is restricted
to 0.05 because the confidence interval adjustments have not been calculated for
other alphas.}

\item{alternative}{Type of test, either "two.sided", "greater" for positive
correlations, or "less" for negative correlations.}

\item{null.value}{Hypothesis to test. Default 0.}

\item{saveboot}{Option to save bootstrap samples. Default TRUE.}

\item{...}{Optional parameter to pass to correlation function.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{estimate} the correlation coefficient.
\item \code{p.value} the p-value of the test.
\item \code{statistic} the t statistic of the test.
\item \code{bootsamples} the bootstrap samples.
}
}
\description{
The default correlation is the percentage bend correlation.
When using Pearson's correlation, the confidence interval is adjusted
to compensate for the error term's heteroscedasticity.
Missing values are automatically removed.

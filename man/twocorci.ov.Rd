\title{Compare two dependent correlations: overlapping case}
\usage{
twocorci.ov(
  x1,
  x2,
  y,
  method = "pbcor",
  nboot = 2000,
  alpha = 0.05,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  null.value = 0,
  saveboot = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1, x2, y}{Three dependent vectors of the same length.}

\item{method}{A function that returns a correlation coefficient.
Options include "spearman", "pbcor", "wincor". Default is "pbcor".}

\item{nboot}{Number of bootstrap samples. Default 2000.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha level. Default 0.05. For corfun = pearson, alpha is restricted
to 0.05 because the confidence interval adjustments have not been calculated for
other alphas.}

\item{alternative}{Type of test, either "two.sided" (default), "greater" for
positive correlations, or "less" for negative correlations.}

\item{null.value}{Hypothesis to test. Default 0.}

\item{saveboot}{Option to save bootstrap samples. Default TRUE.}

\item{...}{Optional parameter to pass to correlation function.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{estimate.x1y} the correlation coefficient between x1 and y.
\item \code{estimate.x2y} the correlation coefficient between x2 and y.
\item \code{difference} the difference between correlation coefficients.
\item \code{conf.int} the bootstrap confidence interval.
\item \code{p.value} the bootstrap p value.
\item \code{bootsamples} the bootstrap samples.
}
}
\description{
Compute a 1-alpha percentile bootstrap confidence interval for the difference
between two correlation coefficients corresponding to two dependent groups,
in the overlapping case. Compare correlation between x1 and y to the
correlation between x2 and y. The default correlation is the percentage
bend correlation. This function is inappropriate to make inferences about
Pearson's correlations. Missing values are automatically removed.
